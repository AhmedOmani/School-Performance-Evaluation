# School Performance Evaluation System

## Goal
The School Performance Evaluation System is designed to help educational institutions assess and improve their performance. It provides a structured framework for collecting evidence, reviewing standards, and tracking progress across various educational domains.

## Features
- **Evidence Management**: Upload and organize evidence files and links to support performance claims.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Structured assessment based on Axes, Domains, and Standards.
- **Review Workflow**: System for reviewing, approving, or rejecting submitted evidence.
- **Dashboard**: Visual overview of performance metrics and submission status.
- **Bilingual Support**: Full support for both Arabic and English interfaces.
- **Role-Based Access**: Secure access control for administrators and staff.

## General Concepts
The system is built around three main Axes of evaluation, each containing specific Domains and Standards. Users submit evidence to demonstrate compliance with these standards, which are then reviewed by system managers to ensure quality and accountability.
